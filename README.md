# tourismassociation
This project is made by using TDD approach in Spring Boot.

<hr/>

This was task for role of Software Developer in Java Backend mainly.


<b>Task:</b>

Design and implement REST API for tourism association of one municipality.


<b>Description:</b>

API should support adding, update and archieving znamenitosti in a municipality.
Landmarks should contain name, description, few photos and geographical coordinates (Lat&Lon).

Visitors should be enabled to search landmark by
name and importance ( remarkable, very remarkable, must see) of just active landmarks.

They can give grades (1-5) for every landmark, and average grade should show by landmark.

-Api should support more municipalities in more different countries.

-implement Api with persistance in relation database, using Java Spring stack.


<b>Bonus:</b>

Create security so the part that manipulates landmarks can use only registered users,
while any (unregistered) users can rate landmark.


<b>Note:</b>

Take the time you need to get familiar with language and TDD approach. Due of the project is 20 days.
While doing task I recomend you to follow technics like clean code, SOLID principles and TDD.

Use git as version control and repository host on some of the cloud services: github, bitbucket or gitlab.
It is important that it have as much commits so we can see the process and dynamic whitch you developed the and not just finished code.


Good luck.
